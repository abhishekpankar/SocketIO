# socket-io

I've built this Socket.IO app to answer the question asked on http://stackoverflow.com

The server runs on http://localhost:3000/ and the socket connection is opened at http://localhost:3000/test/

The client has one connection to the server (for test purpose) and served the index.html on the same port as server
